This is the Project I did for my CAPE Computer Science School Based Assessment.
This is the background of the business and problem statment used for the writeup for the assessment:


<h1>**Background:**</h1>

NJ's Tech Store is a small electronics retailer located in Arima, Trinidad and Tobago which buys and resells apple products. They source their products from a variety of suppliers, mostly bulk purchases of overstocked items. Founded in 2015, the store quickly gained a reputation for being the “go-to” place for Apple products at retail price. Despite being a relatively small operation, NJ's Tech Store has built a loyal following of customers who appreciate the quality and affordability of their products. They are open from Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm, and Saturday, 9am to 2pm.

NJ's Tech Store carries a wide range of Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and iMacs. NJ’s Tech Store has only 1 manager, who is the owner, managing 15 employees, 4 of which keep track of all products and 3 work behind the counter selling these products. Currently these employees keep track of stock, sales, and purchases through physical records.


<h1>**Problem Statement:**</h1>

The employees complain to the owner that they have a problem with the current system of keeping records. The physical records have the cons outweighing the pros, that is, it is tedious to write down every sale made, hand writing can be difficult to understand by other employees, the physical record can be damaged or lost. Also, the calculations are done by the employees which can lead to some miscalculations and inaccurate numbers. This method could also decrease the amount of sales done in a day and can dissatisfy customers because of how long it takes to get a sale done.

As a result, a computerization of the stock and sales system is in order. A program is needed that would update the stock of each product, calculate how much money was made from a sale and calculate the profit made for the day. This would decrease the amount of time taken to keep a record of sales and there will be no calculations for profit needed to be done by the user, as it is done by the program. The program will also have added benefits that were not able to be done using physical records or had to be done manually, such as, sorting sales, purchases, and profits in order of most to least, update the stock automatically when a sale is done and display the total amount of sales, purchases and profit made by either all or a specific product.
